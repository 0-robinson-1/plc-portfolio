# plc-portfolio
## Intro

Refreshing my PLC skills since they are a bit outdated and I have not used them much since College.  
I will use OpenPLC Editor locally to build and test the programs and then commit the .st files here for each project.  
I will focus on using Ladder Diagram, Structured Text and Function Block Diagram.
